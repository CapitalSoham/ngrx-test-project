    <p>Why You Need a Strong "About Us" Page
        When a potential client or customer ends up on your site and likes what they see, they'll likely head to your "About Us" page. These visitors are essentially searching for your storyâ€”who are you, and what do you offer? This is your opportunity to shine and build a connection between you and your new visitor. Although you may be 100% business-oriented, your About Us page is your chance to connect on a human level. A great About Us page can help your brand:
        
        Make a good first impression on new site visitors
        Communicate the story, cause, and purpose of your business
        Differentiate you in a positive way from your competition
        Put a more personable face to your brand
        Establish trust that your business is legitimate
        Give customers a reason to purchase from you
        Build loyalty, keeping customers coming back for more
        At the end of the day, your About Us page is essentially a sales page. Based on the story you tell, you will paint a picture that represents who you are as a brand. WHY would a potential client or customer want to buy from you? Put a face to the name, bridging the gap between you and your audience.</p>
